So basically I am at the end of second year of my PhD and sadly the examiners didn’t pass me and I have now been given 3 months to submit the work which is quite extensive work (I need to first gain ethics approval for the study, collect data and analyse it). My supervisors also said that 3 months are not enough. Twice in my PhD my supervisors were changed and the current ones are not helpful at all. Due to first supervisory changes, year 1 was complete waste of time. Now in year 2 alone I wrote 40k words and did so much work. Can you ask the community what would they suggest me to do? 1. Ask the uni to let me switch from full time to part time (I am not sure if they will allow me to do that) to allow myself more time and hopefully examiners would consider that I will have some time. At the moment they are concerned that only one study is completed and I have one year left and another year for write up. 2. Wait until Dec (if examiners don’t pass me this time, they will ask me to graduate with Mphil) 3. Or any other option?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Hello everyone, As a third-year Ph.D. student, I initially prepared for my qualifying exam as advised by my advisor. Despite successfully scheduling the exam and gaining approval for the timing, my advisor later suggested its cancellation. The reason cited was a perceived lack of readiness and knowledge, expressing concerns about potential failure and I haven’t worked enough on the project he gave me just 3 months prior to the exam since he believes the previous one that I was actively work on is not good enough for a thesis.Additionally, my advisor emphasized the need for more progress on a recent project before attempting the candidacy and proposed pursuing a Master's thesis first. Despite my dedication to research and teaching assistant responsibilities, I feel a lack of mentorship, and this situation has left me uncertain about my progress and abilities. Worth to mention that non of the graduated student before me have published any papers that I can use as a good reference for my work. I would appreciate any advice or shared experiences regarding this matter.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I have been offered a FT lecturer role at a top uni in the UK. But I am really struggling to finish my PhD write-up (due Jan24). Supervisors have been very unhelpful in sending feedback. I don’t know what to do - please share your experiences/advice.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Hi, recently I attended an international conference. During the discussion, I wasn't aware of a scientist in the top institute in the country. So, I was treated like a fool. Is it normal?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I am a PhD student in an international university. I come from a global south uni where I worked as RA and TA. In my previous uni, I was promised coauthorship from a professor (let’s call him Prof.Z) , only to later find out they had only put me in acknowledgement on the paper when it was published. I worked on that paper for 2 years. I also know from a friend that prof.Z asked her out repeatedly while she was a student and took back an RAship offer after she said no. My current university is now seeking to reach out to global south academics and Prof.Z might come to my current institution as a visiting academic. Should I flag his behavior to my current supervisor?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I’m looking for some sort of PhD external supervisor/mentor who can help me get to the end of my PhD after being failed, abused and traumatised by my supervisors and university. I desperately want to finish but I need to support and don’t know where to look for it. I’m based in the UK and my PhD is in sociology (gender/sexuality). Any advice would be greatly appreciated!<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">What are others' thoughts on the ban on *paid* proof reading services for phds? Supervisor tells me to just ask family and friends - but first gen PhD students are often not in academic family/social circles. I have PhD colleagues with professor parents who help write their work. It just seems unfair.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I am in the final year(5th year) of my PhD, pursuing PhD in india. Is it common that the Phd supervisor, keeps on asking for research papers, but doesn’t care of the students PhD defence(purposefully postpones defence date), mental health, social life (tries to dictate whom the phd student can be friends with, infact even talks to other supervisor stating that the friendship of the students is affecting their productivity). When i told the supervisor that i don’t want to focus on papers for now and first finish my thesis, he says all the articles must be submitted before thesis submission (For information i already have published enough articles that fulfils my Phd criteria). How does a student deal with such toxic and selfish supervisors, when the system does nothing to solve the problem.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I want to ask what if there is a big argument between student and supervisor, what should we do? (e.g. Supervisor send a really rude email to students)<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">During my first year as a PhD student my boss proposed a collaboration and I accepted because he said there was a possibility of a paper soon. I worked around 3 weeks for that project and measured all the EPR data in this project. Since I was a first year PhD student I didn’t know how to treat the data so my supervisor did it and did not teach me. A few months later, the data was published in paper in a very good journal. The paper had only three authors: the girl I was collaborating with, her PI and my PI. My name was in the acknowledgments together with other people. My boss said that it was ok that my name wasn’t there because there were going to be other projects and did not fight to put my name as an author, and at that time I didn’t really know how that works. When I confronted him today about that (due to another collaboration project he’s making me spend a lot of time on) he said “you need to deliver results, not raw data”. How should I act in this situation? Can I refuse to do this collaboration?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">My supervisor is always telling me how disappointing is my progress as a PhD student, sometimes he compares myself to the other students from the lab, to be honest I don’t know how normal it is. I usually cry after our meetings and I always feel super nervous before. I tried to explain him how hard has been for me this start (I’m a 1st PhD student, like 3 months old). Usually our talks are about how bad I’m on the progress and he telling me that I’m not motivated enough to do the work. Probably is just me and I need to work different, probably I’m just being too sensitive and it is his way to push me<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I have a PhD in cellular and molecular biology and my research is in platelet biology using transgenic mice models. Based on another similar question, I would like to know that is it advisable to skip my PhD supervisor for recommendation letters when applying for jobs? When he is the one I worked most with and have first author publication where it is quite evident who was the P.I. and hence my advisor. Things have turned bitter between me and my advisor because I didn't want to continue as a postdoc within the same toxic lab environment. I feel that he sabotages some of the job opportunities when I put him as a referee. I can't have access to what he says on phone or in recommendation letters about me because the hiring teams say it's confidential. Most of the jobs or postdoc offers require previous employer or PhD advisor recommendation letter. What should I do in this case? I am considering to do a second PhD to avoid this situation and start afresh. Thanks for your support.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Hi, I am sending this on behalf of a friend. We need different perspectives here, we do not want to jump into conclusion. I am not sure what to make of my PhD advisor. I came into the program after assuring him I could contribute effectively to the program and his research. I was thankful to him for getting into the program and always expressed it. He started me on a research and after collecting data for the research, I didn’t hear anything else of that research. The funding probably dried up or he decided not to proceed, but should he not have told us? Shouldn’t there be transparency in these things? Or is he not obligated to tell us? I have had to find mentors in other researchers and have mostly conducted research with them instead of my own advisor. He’s super nit-picky and likes things done a certain way and as I prepare for my dissertation, I worry that this won’t work for me and might slow me down. I know he’s not a bad person but his style of mentorship and research doesn’t work for me. I don’t think I want him on my committee or as my chair. I know I’ll be frustrated if he’s on it. What will you do in my shoes?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I’ve recently been contacted by a PhD student claiming they are just starting on their topic which is basically one of my case studies. I‘ve done all research trips, lots of archival work but got limited resources as external phd with basically minimal guidance by my supervisor so I am asking here: the PhD student was curious if I publish in English or my mother tongue, wanted to watch a presentation I gave some month ago (but there is no recording), claimed a source I mentioned they should read is „super hard to find“ (if you Google it, it’s free online and one of the first shows) and at least two of their guiding questions are the same as mine. Now they arrived in Europe for a fellowship to study the thing and asked me to video chat again. They never saw the object or archives themselves (yet). I voiced my concerns, that we‘ll basically write the same and at that point it might not be wise to meet up. Please share your knowledge, the student seems nice but I made several times experience to be too nice myself and others (ab)use that. I need at least two years more until my thesis is published. Do you recommend not meeting with that person anymore? Shall I quickly try to publish an article on the topic to mark my territory?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">My previous PI was one of these extremely abusive supervisors treating me like shit. I filed complain after I finished so did a previous colleague. The case is that he got fired as he embezzled money. Now he makes her responsible and refuses to sign her thesis or give his consent that she is able to publish a paper or even her thesis as he is the "owner" of the project. She is at the end of her PhD and just need to write. Does anyone has a suggestion what she can do? The Institute manager adviced her to either give up or to look for funding and start a new project. I would be really happy for any help!<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I got a rejection from the HR of a prestigious institution I had a postdoc offer from after the reference check! I know it’s my awful advisor I asked him 3 times before putting his name in the reference list whether he’s willing to SUPPORT my application for the position by a POSITIVE recommendation. He played it so well and assured me he would do so I trusted and failed In my guts I was nervous about it because of all he did throughout my PhD but I got fooled again. He closed his lab for an administrative job and forced me to graduate after 3 years of PhD and didn’t hesitate to blame everything on me in front of everyone in the department who were siding with me because I didn’t want to graduate without papers. I figured everything out later after the application failed because he was again playing the role of a very supportive advisor. I’m very scared. What should I do now?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">A colleague of mine is trying to belittle me and always trying to steer the blame on me for the emerging issues in our joint work. I feel anxious and get panick attacks when i am talking. Now even not able to defend my point of view as i lost all confidence. I need help to neutralize this situation.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I feel so relieved after withdrawing a postdoc application because the potential supervisor was very aggressive in exerting their personal research interest and also rude, saying that I don't know anything about the topic that I am going to work on even though it's based on my doctoral research. How could a senior academic be that rude to a newly minted PhD graduate? Academia could look so ugly, ugh.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I’m in a terrible environment with a very toxic supervisor. I am doing my best to get my PhD done as soon as possible. But I am worried about what comes after. How am I going to get into a good post-doc position without a recommendation from my supervisor. I can definitely not trust them with ever providing a timely or a positive recommendation after I have complained against them and flight for my rights. Any pointers would really help<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Hi! I was a PhD student, in a very toxic lab. During summer semester when I was working on a project for my supervisor, my supervisor paid everybody in my lab, but me. Shall I report this to the the HR? In my school there is not written agreement stating that supervisors must pay their PhD students.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I share a strained relationship with my PhD supervisor. We’d personality clashes, and the work climate deteriorated with time. She had abused her power by delaying my manuscripts, missing lab meetings, and ignoring my emails on several occasions. I had filed an official complaint against her with the department dean, but it was ineffective. She least contributed to my projects, and provided no input to my publications, in fact at one instance she wrongly credited herself as the first author in the article I wrote. After a lot of hardship and obstacles, I was able to submit my PhD after a lot of pushing. I'm now applying for postdoctoral opportunities. I've requested my supervisor for a referral on multiple occasions, but she didn’t respond (she doesn’t respond to my calls either). Other faculty members and a co-supervisor are willing to write a letter of recommendation for me. I'd want to ask you a few questions about the situation: 1.I'm wondering if it's OK to disclose this in my recommendation letters (the absence of a reco from my PI) 2.How to apply for jobs that specifically ask for a PI's reference. 3.What impact does it have on my candidacy? 4.How would you weigh the circumstances (as a member of the recruiting committee)? 5.What is the best response a candidate can give in an interview when questioned about this without sounding bitter? I'm sure I'm not the only one that finds themselves in this scenario. I'm curious to learn all sides of the story and how to properly manage the problem without feeling like a victim in this position, which has had a negative impact on my mental health in the past. Please share your thoughts, victim in this position, and I'm sure you'll be able to assist many others on this boat like me. I'd want to express my gratitude for your response.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I was accepted into a 6 year PhD program with teaching responsibilities. I had academic ambition so I was happy to do the teaching assigned to me and the professors knew it. For years, I was given additional teaching load because "it will be good for my cv." 4 years into the program, one of my advisors started pressuring me to quit early because they needed to hire assistant professors. It was not ideal, but I had enough papers to finish the dissertation. Once I submitted it, the advisor started telling me I needed a PostDoc, my research profile was not good enough, I could not succeed in the interview, and my teaching experience did not matter. Since he knew I wanted to stay in the same university, he told me to get a contract from other universities before he would consider me ready for this university. Afterward, I also found out he has been talking about me behind my back to other university professors. I don't understand why the behavior changed. I have complained about his behavior to the department head and HR, but they have downplayed it as a simple communication breakdown. I am also being pressured to take my complaint back. I am really lost. I know I can get a job elsewhere, but I feel unsafe in the university's hostile environment, and I still need to defend my dissertation. What should I do to undo the damage this advisor has done to my reputation and self-confidence?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">My master's advisor is not supportive. Whenever I go to discuss with him, he doesn't really listen, doesn't read what I send him, and when I come up with a new idea, he tells me "I am not convinced" without stating why. The whole environment at my university is not supportive. I stopped visiting his office and I am relying on myself and the feedback I get from online poster sessions in the US but, currently, I've lost my focus, and have fallen into depression, and procrastination. He has got nothing to tell me but "you should have finished a long time ago" I need slight mentorship (not much) from an external professor in my field, this will motivate me to finish my work. But I also don't want to throw myself on people who don't know me and ask for big favors like this. Do you have some advice for me? Are there any open mentorship programs in math? I am from a developing country.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I recently went into a mid-canditure review and my supervisor started to make me look incompetent in front of my chair, blaming me for all these setbacks that were completely out of my control etc. It was the first time I have ever recieved any negative feedback from them and I was very suprised. I tried to defend myself, but I also didn't want to look like I was attacking them. I tried approaching it with them afterwards and they implied I shouldn't be suprised. I don't want to completely ruin our relationship as they have provided me with a lot of contacts and support but I also don't want to just sweep it under the rug because I need to know where I stand. Any advice for how to go forward would be appreciated.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">To what extent does your PhD supervisor “own” your research topic? I would like to expand on my PhD findinfs in my new lab as a PostDoc, but my supervisor seems to think that any extension of my PhD research would be infringing on their future directions. Does this mean that I will never be able to build on the findings of my PhD when I’m no longer in that lab? Where is the line between being able to build on your findings from your PhD and infringing on your PhD supervisor’s future directions?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">What would you deal with the toxic environment? Your supervisors are very toxic but you are finishing it but you still need their recommendation or help to publish the paper. Is there wise way of dealing with this rather than just ignore my feelings and do what they tell me to do for publication and recommendation letter?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Dear PhDers I am about to submit my 2nd year report with little results. I struggled in my lab to optimise a protocol no one of my group has worked on. About two months ago, my supervisors added a postdoc to my supervisory team without consulting me. Now the postdoc isn’t helpful at all and his feedback is making me feel more worse. The postdoc and I are second language speakers and I really DONT need his help at this stage. His emails are so negative, and I can’t tolerate him anymore. I’m really concerned regarding my PhD and his is stressing me out. Any feedback comments or emotional support are appreciated.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Four months into the program, my advisor decided not to continue working with me without prior notice. Another professor advised me, and now, as I explore research in another lab, I'm feeling disheartened, I’m in so much pain. I'm concerned that my previous advisor might share negative opinions about me, despite their harsh approach and occasional discouragement. It simply didn't work between us, and despite my best efforts, the start was difficult. I'm unsure how to navigate this situation.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Since Jan 2019, Supervisor has been withholding my PhD data ( invention- treatment of a prion disease) to prevent me from defending PhD thesis.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I'm a fifth year PhD student with about 1.5 years left. Since I've started there's been this cycle with my mentor. When I worked 60-80 hours a week he said I was not productive enough and said I needed to work 100. He's threatened to kick me out and wouldn't listen to my ideas. He even tried to embarrass me in front of the other grad students and staff. While I do sometimes struggle with the writing process he doesn't tell me how to fix my issues and instead would tell me to read the same paper on writing over and over. Most recently I was sick and he called me lazy for it. Now, I am level one on the autism spectrum, so I do have some communication issues but he would get angry if I did exactly what he said as if I missed something between the lines. I don't think this ok, but I was pretty far into my program by the time I realized it. What's the best course of action here?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">How to solve the issue of not responding by potential PhD supervisor?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I am 1st yeat PhD, and my supervisor is bullying me and being racist with me so I can’t tolerating her ways of dealing any more. I have tried to discuss with her before as their is a miscommunication between us but she turned the matter around and said that the problem was my level of English language, even though I got 7 in the IELTS. She also gossiped this to her colleagues instead of solve the miscommunication problem with me. After this situation I felt difficulty to discuss any issue with her. I decide to withdraw my studies and I will meet her next week to discuss that. The real reason is her maltreatment but I prefer to tell something neutral to make my drop out process more easier and quicker. If you suggest me neutral reason I would really appreciate you<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">It's the fifth time that my supervisor asks me to do a ppt/abstract/poster for a conference, but then it comes that he puts himself as a first author and goes to the conference without us, stating that "it's too expensive and the group can't afford paying the entrance for phd students". I know it's his job, it just feel frustrating to do the work and not be recognised. Any advice?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">How do y'all deal with lab mates having bad days and taking it out on others in the lab? Often the day is tense, but by the next day everyone moves on. However, no one ever apologizes for their behavior and these kinds of days are occurring more often. It's starting to wear on the lab environment and I don't know how to address it.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I am a second year JRF and my supervisor is very toxic. She made me work day and night and didn't gives me leave also. She even don't allow me to go to nearest dental hospital as she thinks my dental treatment is not urgent. She don't think of anything in front of paper deadline. I even can't go out to enjoy in weekends also and this made my batch mates to exclude me and they don't call me to any picnic of party. My hair density and body became half than what was in the initial time. I was more interested in teaching so to become a professor I went for PhD but after suffering from 2 years i decided to quit and am looking for teaching opportunities nearby. She didn't consider health as excuse and interfere in my personal matters. However, i saw that post doc people are also not getting any proper and stable job so working with a toxic guide made me leave PhD. I love teaching than anything else and I was not interested in doing post doctoral research. Please give your suggestions. Thanks<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Is his Ph.D in the same area of the course? How old is it? He is maybe just a bad teacher<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">How common is it to cry after a meeting with your supervisor? It's really tough when they tell me I haven't made any progress, even though I'm constantly working and trying to accomplish everything, in addition to all the challenges that come with moving to another country and adapting to a new life.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I was wondering what people thought about ignoring your supervisor? Is it ever ok? They are not an academic but are one of my supervisors but I disagree with them and they just don’t understand my project? Do I have to take their advice?<span></li>

I don’t have a clue what kind of accommodations might be useful for an oral exam Do folks in the academic community have any thoughts or suggestions?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I am a PhD student at ANU, Australia. My PhD supervisor provided insufficient supervision during the writing of my thesis, leading to a highly stressful PhD experience. Unfortunately, the rest of my supervisory panel never had a single meeting with me, which resulted in me submitting the thesis independently. Regarding the outcome of my thesis, the HDR convener has advised me to either seek another examiner or apply for an MPhil. I have received one report with minor corrections, one failed report, and one revise and re-submit report (which I assume to be the final one). I am puzzled as to why the school is not granting me the opportunity to revise and resubmit my thesis in this case. While I had the chance to briefly review the reports at school, both negative reports criticize the lack of novelty in my research and insufficient experimentation for the thesis. However, according to the oral presentation milestone I have achieved, it was my supervisor, who is now retired, who commented that I have conducted enough experiments to warrant an A-grade PhD thesis. It has been 7 years since I started my PhD journey. I had my final oral presentation in December 2019. However, I am still struggling to complete my PhD. Any helpful advice is highly appreciated.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I recently submitted my PhD thesis, however no information has been provided from the university re what happens next (specifically, how long it may take examiners to read/review the thesis). I realise this can be variable & take a long time, but surely universities set *some* kind of guidelines/expectations around this, which, in turn, can be communicated to candidates?! Given cost-of-living crisis, financial devastation and career stasis that can result from years spent doing a PhD, this lack of info is out of touch. What info have other candidates received after they have submitted their thesis, regarding this? Do other universities have systems in place for communicating this info?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I have my phd defense in 2 months and have not secured a job for afterwards. that is freaking me out while i have to finish writing my thesis. any tips for calming oneself? or even tips for securing a short-term remote job to keep a fresh graduate afloat while looking for a "proper" job?

I barely tolerate the loud noises.. In addition to that, I am not drinking alcohol due to religious restrictions.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I had my PhD viva a few days ago and I really enjoyed it (and did very well, I think). The examiners acknowledged my original contribution to knowledge without even asking me that question. Nevertheless, I passed with "Major Revisions" which came a bit as a shock (to my supervisor as well) after a well-managed viva. The examiners said I won't need another viva again as they were very pleased with me but that my thesis would need some major revisions. They are confident that I will be able to make them even before the 12 months deadline. While I'm waiting for their report on the amendments I should make, I am experiencing some mixed feelings now and interrogating my worth. Was a PhD the right thing for me? After amendments, will they accept it? Why are most people congratulating me when I really feel like it is a "revise and resubmit" and that I nearly failed? I am lost and confused.”<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I have been through so much things and had hard time since I submitted my thesis back in Jan. I just received an email telling me that the viva is going to be in 2 weeks and I started to panic. What is the best way to prepare for it in this short time and how to organise the presentation slides<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">A patent, a first-author paper and a summa cum laude thesis dissertation: those were the products of my doctorate and that I gave in part to my thesis supervisor. On the day of my defense, I had defended from another country because I had started my postdoc, on the day of my defense I expected at least a phrase of personal congratulations from my director, (a person who has known me since I was 19, I am currently 28 years old) I trained with him in the BSc and the MSc. We had an incredible collegial relationship. On the day of my defense, he didn't say anything to me personally two months later, he hasn't spoken to me he stopped talking to me thoughts?” Perhaps he’s just busy and distracted<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Apologies in advance for bothering you all! I had my viva and got a deferral. I have 1 year to resubmit with the corrections the examiners provide me to work on. The examiners said I had an excellent viva. They praised my work. But there are many discussions that were not unpicked. I wish my supervisors could help me more. However, I'm not blaming them. It's all my fate. My supervisors said that they'll help me do the resubmission before 1 year. I have very low morale and self-confidence now. I often have anxiety attacks and depression bouts thinking of my studies. I'm also a patient of PTSD, going through a very rough phase. Sadly, the supervisors are not very helpful both emotionally and in terms of their knowledge of my topic. I understand that I will have to cross the ocean all by myself. I'm in Britain. Is there anyone with such experience of resubmission after viva in England's universities? Please share your experience. I may connect with them for moral support if they agree. Is there a chance to pass from deferral if I revise everything according to the examiner's feedback? How much is the chance to pass if there is at all? Thank you!<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">My thesis defense is due in 20 days. How did you react to receiving the evaluators' comments on your work? How to deal with problems in your objectives and hypotheses. Finally, your best advice for D-day. thank you!<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Regarding my PhD thesis examination outcome, I have received one report with minor corrections, one failed report, and one major corrections report. Is it possible for the weight to be given only to the major revisions and failed report, resulting in a failed outcome? My HDR conveners recommendations are below. we could proceed with the Fail recommendation for your PhD thesis, and we would subsequently invite you to revise and resubmit your thesis for an MPhil, after you consider and respond to the examiners' scientific criticisms. we could send the submitted version of the PhD thesis to a further examiner, but our view, from the reports that we already have, was that a negative outcome following additional review of the submitted PhD thesis was likely. I submitted my thesis alone as my supervisor left me without support. I begged for help with my thesis, but no one at the school assisted me. Are there any regulations regarding this matter? I have already contacted the Dean of HDR and the college, but I feel alone and without assistance. Is there anyone who can provide advice or advocate for a fair evaluation of the report? Please advise me.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">The viva will be held next month. I feel down and frustrated. I have prepared plan what I should focus on; however, the more I add the more I feel I know nothing! My concern is trying to focus on every single thing, while I am personally cannot do that I have bad memory. I have read the general question/tips. I have marked the typos ..etc. Two thing I am worried about: statistical part (although I did by myself), and literature review which I cannot remember everything. I will selected key published papers, but I CANNOT cover all studies. How can I show my interest and keep motivated? What the PhD criteria?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">My dissertation defense is in a few months, but I'm already feeling extremely anxious. I'm not the type of person who excels in front of a large group, and I don't usually think on my feet. I can already anticipate blanking out and not being able to respond to many of the questions.

Then, a recent conflict in the Middle East started, I left for safety, and working remotely was complicated to communicate with my supervisor.

Sometimes I have asked directly to PI about not feeling well with these things and I don't even know the language, staying away home has topped up more insecurity. I decided to quit. Now after the trauma, I have more questions how to speak with PI, colleagues, should I limit my social circles? One advice I get now is drop the idea of PhD and to an extend switch the field.

How did your advisors react, and what accommodations did you receive?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">Hi my current uni is making redundancies and this may or may not include my supervisors (I have three). The process will take a couple of months at least. Whilst the uni has said I will continue to get supervision my supervisors are specialists in their field. I'm looking for advice from anyone who has gone through anything similar, whether I can transfer, what the uni's responsibilities are & what I can do. I have two more years left at least.

I am loosing hope because I could not maintain a good research track and although I have gotten two interview offers out of 6 PhDs I have applied to, with every rejection I feel like I have destroyed my chances of getting into PhD research position as I feel like I do not have much to show since I could not progress with my thesis. Can I still salvage my research experience and hope for being in academia?<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I am about to start the final year of my PhD and I am experiencing a lot of anxiety .I have so much work to still do and this huge deadline is looming - any advice for students about to face their final year??” This too shall pass. Breathe. Reflect. Do what YOU feel is the right thing to do. We don’t control the outcome. Enjoy yourself. Memento Mori.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">I'm so tired and my health issue is destructing my studies.

Recently, I had a similar experience with another faculty member. I'm curious if this is a common practice in the academic job search process, and if anyone else has had a similar experience. I would appreciate any advice or insights on how to navigate this kind of situation.

Apart from that, all things seem to be equally good in both opportunities. I spoke with students from both labs and they only had good things to say.

This will also be in the same university as I am passionate in my field of research. I have enjoyed my degrees to date, especially my master, and get on very well with my supervisor both personally and professionally. My supervisor has supported me throughout, taking me on fieldwork, helping me to publish (at masters level) and build up my CV to a good enough standard to secure the PhD studentship. I adore my work and am excited to expand upon it; however, now that the PhD is due to start I cannot help built feel like I should have been more considerate to moving abroad, to a different university. I did not as I did not think I was good enough or that other universities would want me, however, now I realise that maybe I am. I am torn as every forum and website I read says that having the right supervisor is the most important thing when finding a PhD and I know I have that. However, I also know the importance of relocating in an academic career and I think I am tired of being in the same city. It has always been a dream to move and experience new cultures but now I am worried I have closed that door and do not know if I have made the right decision or not. Any advice or similar experience would be much appreciated.<span></li><li><span class="sensitive">is it a red flag when multiple PhD students/postdocs/lab assistants/undergrad researchers quit or get fired from a small lab in a single year?

I expect to be done with my program soon and am horrified what comes next.

I was considering going to industry too for a short period but I am not sure if that is possible. I love academia and would like to stay there but I also want to take some time and rest after I get my PhD. Does anyone have experience or stories if abandoning research for a year or two after getting your PhD and then coming back to it is at all possible?

My peers with similar qualifications have all received at the least several interviews and in multiple cases have even been made competing job offers. I on the other hand have not even received an offer to interview from any of the more than dozen jobs I have applied for (ranging from tenure track positions all the way to adjunct). When I reach out to ask if the respective search committees could provide any feedback to help me become more marketable, they say they cannot because my application was done correctly and met the needs of the position, usualky folloing us with "it just didn't work out this time" or something similar. The only thing I can think of different between myself and my peers is that I am openly queer and my research involves queer theory. Is the political climate where queer instructors are being denied tenure and even being purged from institutions in certain states like Florida making my queerness and my specialization a hiring liability? Should I begin to give up my dream and move on to private sector jobs or start looking at overseas teaching openings? Any insight would really help, even if it is a heartbreaking truth.<span></li>

In the manuscript, the writer reports statistical findings for component X that is different between 2 groups. While the p-vals are < .05, they do not survive multiple comparison correction (which is reported). However, throughout the rest of the manuscript, they keep referring to the difference in component X between our 2 groups. A whole paragraph in the discussion is devoted to this difference in X. I've pointed out that you can't claim a difference given that the results didn't survive the correction. Both my colleague and PI of the lab respond by saying that although the difference is not 'statistically' significant, given that the p-vals are < .05 you can still claim a difference that you can report. At the moment I've suggested to switch to reporting effect sizes, but they are very reluctant on doing so and don't seem to take my remarks seriously. How should I proceed?
